# API Factory

The API Factory is a WebAPI for managing and sharing streaming data with the support of open schema specifications.
Its main goal is to make it easier to set up APIs on-demand, based on specifications such as JSON schemas.

Guidance for installation and usage can be found on the [project wiki](https://github.com/mkdf/api-factory/wiki).

The Open University develops the API Factory with support from the [MK:5G Connecting Communities](https://cp.catapult.org.uk/opportunities/mk5g-connecting-communities/) project as an open-source product to the benefit of developers, businesses and researchers.

The API Factory is part of the [MK Data Factory](https://github.com/mkdf/) collection of components for distributed, policy-aware data cataloguing and management. 

Vision statement:

*5G will bring enhanced connectivity to cities enormously, increasing the variety of applications and use cases. 
In such a distributed environment, it is crucial to support systems interoperability in an agile way, thus reducing the time and cost of development.*

*The API Factory serves the [MK:5G](https://cp.catapult.org.uk/opportunities/mk5g-connecting-communities/) development community by providing a catalogue of IoT and SmartCity data models from cutting-edge Industry standards. Developers can select and mix them to build customised Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) on-demand, tailored specifically to their product.*
