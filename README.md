# API FACTORY

*5G will bring enhanced connectivity to the cities enormously, increasing the variety of applications and use cases. 
In such a distributed environment, it is crucial to support systems interoperability in an agile way, thus reducing the time and cost of development. 

The API Factory serves the [MK:5G](https://cp.catapult.org.uk/opportunities/mk5g-connecting-communities/) development community by providing a catalogue of IoT and SmartCity data models from cutting-edge Industry standards. Developers can select and mix them to build customised Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) on-demand, tailoring the specificity of their product. 

The Open University develops The API Factory as an open-source product to the benefit of technologists, businesses, and researchers.*
